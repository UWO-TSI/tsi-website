# Lane: tasting-book (what sushi does)

Worktree `.claude/worktrees/tasting-book`, branch `game/tasting-book`, cut from `game/fishing-depth` at 0db249b4 (it needs that branch's new menu layout; fishing-depth merges to main first, then this one). Agent type `uwotsi-lane`. Dev port 3476.

## David's call (fishing r4 review, 2026-11-01, f4-mechanic, verbatim)

"i think the dinner service is cool way to have mini game that makes money, so that maybe in next launch, and the tasting book should be impliment ed and one per fish kinda thing and they can either turn into meal that gets buff and a stamp or in the aquarium."

So:
- **Build the tasting book.** One entry per fish species. A fish you bring can go one of two ways:
  - **a meal:** Bancha cooks it, you get that dish's buff and the species' stamp in the book;
  - **the aquarium:** the fish goes into the aquarium instead.
- **Dinner service** (evening counter shifts, a slice, press and plate rhythm, tips) is for the next launch. Don't build it; add it to `specs/launch/` as a next-launch item with David's quote.
- The club feast was not picked. Don't build it.

The proposal he was answering (from the review page): "Bancha makes a nigiri from any species you bring. Each new one stamps a page of a tasting book at the back of the menu, a page per water. You chase the empty stamps." Cost: "The fish and a small coin fee". Reward: "The dish's buff, the stamp, and at 10, 25 and a full water a title, a bar stool for home or a rod part".

## Read first

- `specs/lanes/fishing-depth.md` (the menu, the dishes and buffs, the sushi bar code map), `specs/launch/sushi-bar.md`, `web/lib/game/sushiBar.ts`.
- The aquarium: `web/components/game/hq/Aquarium.tsx` and `specs/interiors/hq.md` (HQ's back-wall tank, today a line of text on E). Also the museum's donate and curator flow (`donate`, `curator` in `DefaultIslandWorld.tsx`): find out whether fish can already be donated there, so you don't build a second donation path.
- `web/lib/collections/` (caught species, the collection book).

## Build

1. **Data:** a stamp per user per species, stored server-side with RLS, written only by a server check that the player had the fish and it left their bag. A new migration (timestamped after the newest on main), never edit an applied one. Stop and tell the coordinator before anything touches prod; the coordinator applies it.
2. **At the counter:** with a fish in your bag, Bancha offers "Cook it" (the meal: buff plus stamp; the stamp only the first time per species) or "For the aquarium". Keep it to the counter's existing UI kit; no new modal style.
3. **The book:** the back pages of the menu, a page per water, one slot per species: empty, stamped (cooked) or marked as in the aquarium. Same paper and type as the new menu.
4. **The aquarium:** the species you gave shows up in it. Decide whether HQ's tank is shared by the club (everyone's gifts swim together) or per player, from what the code and specs already say, and say which in your report. Smallest version that reads in a shot.
5. **Milestones** (10, 25, a full water): only with rewards that already exist in the economy. Titles and the home bar stool only if those items exist; the rod part waits for the new rod roster (Meshy). List anything you skipped.

Coin fee and buff values go in the existing economy tables and rules. Never write the gem-to-money rate anywhere.

Dish pictures stay the labelled stand-ins: David wants each dish modelled with Meshy, edited in Blender, rendered to a 2D photo for the menu and used in 3D on the plate, and that waits for the Meshy key. Don't make other art for them.

## Gates and evidence

vitest (with and without `NEXT_PUBLIC_GAME_WORLD=new`), tsc, eslint on changed files, a migration test against a local or staging copy (never prod), and headless shots desktop and phone: the counter choice, a cooked stamp landing, the book pages (empty, partly stamped), the aquarium with a gift in it. One `perf:check` only if the aquarium renders new fish. Evidence in `specs/evidence/tasting-book/`, then report to the coordinator with the head SHA, gates, evidence, the migration file names and anything you couldn't verify.

## Rules

- Headless only: never open a window, tab, app or audio on David's screen; never `open`; never the Playwright MCP, the claude-in-chrome tools or the `blender` MCP tools. Blender only as `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender -b --factory-startup -P <script>`. Never ports 3000, 3300, 3301.
- Locks: `LANE=game/tasting-book /Users/DavidLiu/.claude/jobs/62203045/tmp/withlock.sh heavy|devserver|blender <cmd>`; exit 75 means retry. Supabase env blanked on your dev server.
- The fishing-depth lane works on its branch in parallel (catch board, signs, cover line, showroom captions). Keep out of `wharf.ts` and the catch board; if you need something of theirs, ask the coordinator.
- New world only (the village is retired). No fetched art. Real names never show in game. Commit `[build]`, never push, never bare `git stash`. No em dashes. Ponytail code (`specs/lane-rules.md`).

Not started.
