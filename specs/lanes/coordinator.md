# Coordinator handoff

For the next coordinator session. Start fresh from this file, `STATE.md` and the lane files beside it. Don't start from old chat history.

## Who does what

- **The coordinator:**
  - runs the lanes as background agents, one worktree each, under `.claude/worktrees/`;
  - publishes every visual change to David as a review page with Approve/Redo and a note per item;
  - reads his decisions back;
  - merges approved work into `feat/game-default-island` and pushes it to main;
  - applies prod migrations.
- **Lanes:** never push and never talk to David.
- **Restarting lanes:** done automatically, fresh from their file in `specs/lanes/`, when a lane has run for hours, its context is huge, or it's idle after a review (David, 2026-10-18).

## Helpers

All in `~/.claude/jobs/62203045/tmp/`, which survives reboots.

- `push-main.sh`: fetches, refuses if origin moved, runs tsc if `web/` TS changed, then pushes feat and main.
- `build-approvals.py out.html "Title" items.json`:
  - each item is `{id, label, facts, img}`, where `img` is a local webp, png or jpg path;
  - it uses `approve-template.html` and stores decisions in the `approvals` collection;
  - publish with `capabilities: {"db": {}}`, then read the decisions with ArtifactData `list approvals`.
- `prod-dump.sh <label>`, `prod-query.sh <sql>` and `verify.sql` are for prod migrations. The procedure is in `STATE.md` and the memory files.
- `withlock.sh heavy|blender|devserver <cmd>` (set `LANE=game/<lane>`): takes a lock, waiting while swap is high and another lock is held. It lives in `~/.claude/jobs/62203045/tmp/`, the same folder as the helpers above, and is referenced from `specs/lane-rules.md`.

## Lanes as of 2026-10-22 (launch run)

The run sheet is `specs/launch/v1-launch.md` (ledger row 317). The freeze is Oct 24 and the launch Oct 31.

| Lane | Branch | State |
|---|---|---|
| HQ interior | `game/hq-interior` | Switching to layout B with taller ceilings (David, Oct 19). It merges only if approved by Oct 24 |
| Flat UI | `game/flat-ui` | Round 3 panels and motion are with David: https://claude.ai/artifact/7HiNbT9LBysksR13Y4p36w. Next is step 8, the creator. The four cream menus have no verdict yet: https://claude.ai/artifact/5VW76H2kqZJePHCobKEY9T |
| Wardrobe follow-up | `game/wardrobe-followup` | The #04 visor logo (golden arches flipped into a W), then the merch catalogue migration. The coordinator applies it to prod |
| Launch | `game/launch-v1` | Phase A: investigate the Preview, the env vars, test accounts, the two-account test design and the smoke flows. It waits for the coordinator's OK before anything outward-facing |
| Perf | `game/perf-v1` | Phase A: deterministic comparison, both builds, the A/B script. Then a quiet window, when David closes his apps |

Wardrobe batch 2 merged on Oct 22 and its seed was applied to prod.

## Merge check: ponytail

Before merging a lane branch that adds more than about 300 lines of code, run a read-only ponytail review of its diff. Use an Explore agent: `git diff main...<branch> -- web realtime`, judged against `~/.claude/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md`. It looks for:
- duplicates of existing code;
- dead code left behind;
- unrequested abstractions;
- new dependencies.

Fix what's cheap before the merge, and log the rest in the current ponytail audit (`specs/ponytail-audit-*.md`). The codebase audit runs as its own lane (`specs/lanes/ponytail.md`).

## Waiting on David

- **Merch:** close-ups of the lanyard's snap hook (face-on and side-on) and the D-ring, and a recording of the keychain click.
- **Yearly flag designs:** for the HQ banners.
- **Stock limits** for the merch, if any.
- **The Roblox Studio attachment values,** from the Lua script; the hats are estimates until then.
- **Photos of real tees and prints** for the shop pegboard's stand-ins.
- **Writing only he does:** Bram's and Wren's lines, and the Founder's plaque text.
- **Building exteriors:** remodelled later. HQ's outside stays as it is for now.
- **Profile customisation price:** 5,000 gems, flagged as high.

## Queued after today

- Fallen leaf piles under trees.
- One combined perf:check on a quiet machine, then a baseline refresh.
- The MacBook Air speed check, at the very end.

## Standing rules (short)

The full set is in `CLAUDE.md`, `specs/lane-rules.md` and the memory files.

- Never reveal the gem rate anywhere public. The repo is public; specs carry gem prices only.
- Never open windows, apps or tabs on David's screen. Never use the Playwright MCP.
- David supplies every art reference.
- Real names never show.
- Never edit applied migrations.
- Stop for anything destructive, costing money or irreversible. Otherwise merge and deploy verified, approved work without asking.
- No idle polling.
