# Lane: sky-ambient (the sky, the wind and the island's ambient effects)

Worktree `.claude/worktrees/sky-ambient`, branch `game/sky-ambient`, cut from origin/main f3d24212. Agent type `uwotsi-lane`. Dev port 3480.

## David's call (2026-11-04, verbatim)

"i want you to run a lane and artifact process for game skybox and ambiant, so sky wind, effects etc"

## Round 1: what's there, then pitches for David's pick (nothing ships)

1. **Read what exists first** (CODEMAP rows "Rendering look", "Time, weather, season", "Nature, grass, FX"): the sky (`SkyDome.tsx`, `skyShader.ts`, `IslandAtmosphere.tsx`: dome, gradient, sun and moon, clouds, stars, how it moves through `worldClock` and the sun path, how weather changes it), the weather (`weatherSystem`, `islandWeather`, `RainFX`, `WeatherGround`, `?weather=rain|snow|fog|wind`), the wind (grass `grassField`, trees and bushes in `InstancedNature`, flags, cloth, water chop: is there one shared wind, its direction and strength, gusts), and the ambient effects (`AmbientLife`, `fireflySwarm`, `ambientFauna`, `Critters`, `Seagulls`, `lib/game/fx/`, puddles). Also ambient sound (wind, waves, birds, rain) if any: list it, don't build it. Write down for each: the file, what it does now, what's a stand-in, and what it costs. David's look references are in `specs/references/acnh/` and `look/` (the art direction: simple, smooth, cartoony, ACNH-like, subtle texture; performance first). The title-r2 branch gave the title screen its own star twinkle (`uStarry`, title only): keep the game's sky consistent with it.
2. **Shoot today:** headless shots of the island with plenty of sky in frame (two or three angles) at dawn, midday, golden hour, sunset, dusk and night, and in each weather; a few-second clip (mp4) of the wind on grass and trees, and of each weather moving. Use `?time=` / `?weather=` and the dev hooks.
3. **Pitch, built just far enough to shoot (behind dev-only switches):**
   - **Sky:** two or three directions (for example a painted cartoon gradient with soft stylised clouds that drift, a richer sunset and dusk, a night sky with a moon, twinkling stars and the odd shooting star), each through the day and in weather.
   - **Wind:** one shared wind (direction, strength, slow gusts) driving grass, trees, bushes, flags and loose particles together, stronger on `?weather=wind` and storms; show it calm, breezy and stormy.
   - **Ambient effects:** a short menu of cheap effects that fit the island (drifting leaves or petals by season, pollen and dust motes in sunbeams, sea spray and foam at the shore, birds crossing the sky, butterflies, the fireflies at night, rain splashes and mist): build the few you recommend, list the rest.
   Each option with its cost (draws, triangles, frame time; one perf:check on the scene you touched at the end, compared with main back to back). Recommend one per area.
4. **No fetched art.** If a direction needs a reference, say what to ask David for. No paid generation (no ElevenLabs, no Meshy).
5. **Output:** `specs/sky-ambient.md` (the audit table, the options, the costs, questions for David), evidence under `specs/evidence/sky-ambient/r1/` with ids `sky1-*` (stills and short mp4 clips, day and night, desktop and phone), and a report. The coordinator puts it on a review page. After David's marks, the losing options and their switches get deleted.

## Rules

- Headless only: never open a window, tab, app or audio on David's screen; never `open`; never the Playwright MCP, the claude-in-chrome tools or the `blender` MCP tools. Blender only as `/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender -b --factory-startup -P <script>`. Never ports 3000, 3300, 3301, 3390.
- Locks: `LANE=game/sky-ambient /Users/DavidLiu/.claude/jobs/62203045/tmp/withlock.sh heavy|devserver|blender <cmd>`; exit 75 means retry.
- If `web/node_modules` is missing: `cd web && npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` under the heavy lock.
- Commit `[build]`, never push, never bare `git stash`. No em dashes. Ponytail (`specs/lane-rules.md`). Never write the gem-to-money rate. Real names never show in game.
